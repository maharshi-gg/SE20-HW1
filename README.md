The repo has been created as part of CSC 510 - Software Engineering 2020 course's HW1

### PURPOSE
* What's the purpose of a team creating such a repo?
  * All team members get to understand and create a professional github repository ready to be build-tested and release-test while also ensuring industry standards are met.

### .gitignore
* Why add a gitignore file?
  * Certain builds, code runs and tests create various temp files, make use of certain binaries and sometimes, the code has some local config files that are not required to be uploaded to the repository. In certain cases, some proprietary data files are also added so as to safeguard datasets. A gitignore file reminds Git to not commit and push all the names of the files/directories listed in it. 

### Travis
* What does Travis CI do and How does it help?
  * As per Travis CI's blog - "The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments". Travis CI is a continuous integration tool that automatically builds and tests code changes, commits and pushes. It also helps in deployment and notifications. 

### CITATION
* How does Zenodo work and why should we add it?
  * Zenodo enables researches and developers make their program, code or project be citable and trackable. All the data is stored in CERN's Data Centres, enables versioning and provides trustable access to various author's content using DOIs.

### CODE OF CONDUCT
* What policies should be followed throughout project developement?
  * This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community, and this lists some behaviors that contributes to creating a positive environment in the community.

### Contributing
* What are the guidelines to follow when contributing to this repo?
  * When contributing to this project, first discuss the ideas you want to make changes to, how those will make the project better, and a proposed milestone. Once this gets confirmed by all the members, the changes can then be made.

### LICENSE
* Currently licensed under MIT License.
  * This enables developers to use and make available their own code as, open-source while retaining the commerical value of their code. 

### Requirements
* What's the purpose of this?
  * It specifies the required packages and their versions for all the project maintainers and users so as to enable uniformity and standard builds across all.

### setup.py
* What's the use case of a setup file?
  * It describes the module/package to be install that have been packaged and distributed. This allows everyone to easily install Python packages and dependecies.

### data/, code/, test/ folders
* More deets, more deets, more deets!
  * Data/ contains the data that the code under Code/ while Test/ contains all the tests that run for the written code.
